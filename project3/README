Homework 3 - readme
--------------------------------------------------

Files Includes With This Project:
Main.c
Mymake
README
producer.c
consumer.c
utils.c
header.h

--------------------------------------------------

(1) How to compile the program
$ make
$ ./wcs #consumer filename -p: for -p case
$ ./wcs #consumer filename -b #queue_size : for -b case
$ ./wcs #consumer filename -bp #queue_size : for -bp case

--------------------------------------------------

(2) Your and your partners individual contributions
Most parts of the project were done by both of us. Eric implemeted the entire project
briefly, then Mihoko modified and added details for functionalities. In addition, log
print and creating result.txt are written by Mihoko. Both of us tested the project
and fixed the problems and segmentation fault together.
--------------------------------------------------

(3) Any assumptions outside this document
- Existing txt files are in the same directory. It prevents us from inputting the whole path for
the txt file. We only need to input filename in the command line.
- One line of input file has at most 1024.
- One input file has at most 10000 lines.
- If input file does not exist, log.txt and result.txt will be empty.

--------------------------------------------------

(4) What exactly your program does





--------------------------------------------------

(5) If you have attempted extra credit
We have attempted extra credit, and it gives the right result.
