--------------------------------------------------

(2) How to compile and run the program

compile:
$ make

run:
$./server <Server Port>
$ ./client <Folder Name> <# of Mappers> <Server IP> <Server Port>

--------------------------------------------------

(3) Your and your partners individual contributions

Eric implemented the client side and Mihoko worked on the server side. We both
worked on the error handling regardless on our part and extra credits. For counting
words for each path, Eric refered to some functions used in Project 2. Sending and
receiving requests and responses are implemented by both of us mainly using write()
and read() functions. azList and updateStatus are implemented by Mihoko. 

--------------------------------------------------

(4) Any assumptions outside this document
We assumed there is no MapperInput or log folder exist in the same folder, as well as
a given file name exists in the same folder or else, the path to the file is given.
Also, server takes mapperID that bigger than 0 and -1 for extra credit, thus there
is no error message to tell for Master(extra credit) because we assume -1 as a correct
mapperID.
Only Server side handles and prints out the error message on terminal such as wrong
mapperID and wrong commands.
If clients send a request with an empty file, client prints out the error message on
terminal but log.txt remains empty, but server doesn't do anything.
The maximum number of mapper is 32 as mentioned in the documents.
The minimum number of mapper is 1.
--------------------------------------------------

(5) If you have attempted extra credit
We have attemped extra credit. It print out the expected output correctly.
